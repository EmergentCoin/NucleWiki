Think of a seed as a tree and a wallet address as a branch. When you import a seed to the native Chia wallet, it sees all branches (addresses) for that tree since it is a FULL blockchain wallet.

But Nucle is an SPV wallet, which means it only sees the first branch of \"first wallet address.\" Nucle does not track all the branches as a full blockchain wallet does. That's why Nucle is a lightweight wallet since it only tracks a single wallet address of a seed that can contain infinite branches/addresses.
